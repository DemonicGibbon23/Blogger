## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nivedck/Blogger.git
   cd Blogger
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/bloggr
   SESSION_SECRET=your_random_secret
   ```

   Replace the MongoDB URI and session secret with the appropriate values for your environment.

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

### Administrator Setup

node scripts/seedAdmin.js
```

Follow the prompts to configure the account. Public registration creates regular user accounts only.

## Security

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
- Session-based authentication protects restricted operations.
- Role-based authorization separates administrator privileges from regular users.
- Environment variables are used for sensitive configuration.
- Server-side validation and access checks help protect application data.
